# TND004 Labs

Labs for the course TND004 (Data Structures) at Link√∂ping University.

To compile and run a lab, navigate to the `build` folder of that lab, and run
cmake and then make (or whatever you choose):

```bash
cd lab1/build
cmake ..
make
./lab1
```

If you want to create a Xcode project, run `cmake -G Xcode ..` in the build
folder, and then open the project in Xcode. When compiling, make sure you
select the proper scheme.
